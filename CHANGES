A number of people reported failures running the test suite.  I bet
the problem is a bug in File::Recurse.  I sent the author a patch
months ago and it never got released.  Please use either
'Recurse/patch' or move 'Recurse/Recurse.pm' into the top level of the
distribution to repair your copy.

This is what it should look like:

[joshua@grdevl137] /nw/dev/perl/LinkTree/LTree% make test
cp LinkTree.pm ./blib/lib/File/LinkTree.pm
Skip ./blib/lib/File/Recurse.pm (unchanged)
PERL_DL_NONLAZY=1 /nw/dev/usr/bin/perl -I./blib/arch -I./blib/lib -I/nw/dev/usr/lib/perl5/sun4-solaris/5.00452 -I/nw/dev/usr/lib/perl5 -e 'use Test::Harness qw(&runtests $verbose); $verbose=0; runtests @ARGV;' t/*.t
t/linktree..........ok
All tests successful.
Files=1,  Tests=3, 22 secs ( 2.57 cusr  1.84 csys =  4.41 cpu)

Also added a -F force flag.

Improved the precision of LINKTREES directory listing.  Now it notices
if only a single sub-tree is symlink'd.
