LinkTree

Attempt at the definitive linktree implementation. 

                                 -*-

File::LinkTree - Creates symlink trees.  Also can prune bad links and
unused directories.

Command line programs linktree and prunetree provide interfaces to the
library.

                                 -*-

Hopefully, this package will eventually be rolled into a File::*
bundle.

                                 -*-

Requires File::Recurse (part of File::Tools module).
